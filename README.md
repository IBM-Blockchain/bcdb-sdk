# Orion Blockchain Database - Go SDK

A Go SDK for the [Hyperledger Labs Orion](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/orion-server) Blockchain Database.

The SDK allows the developer to conveniently connect to an Orion database cluster and execute data transactions and queries, as 
well as perform administration operations.

The [examples/api](./examples/api) package contains a complete set of working examples on every aspect of the API.

The [examples/cars](./examples/cars) package contains a self-service demo of a car registry using the Orion blockchain 
database. This demo shows how to make use of multi-signature transactions in order to manage asset ownership.
